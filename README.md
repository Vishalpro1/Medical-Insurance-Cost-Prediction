This project aims to predict individual medical insurance costs based on demographic and health-related factors using Machine Learning.

The dataset includes features such as:

Age – Age of the individual

Gender – Male or Female

BMI – Body Mass Index

Children – Number of dependents

Smoker – Whether the person smokes or not

Region – Residential area (northeast, northwest, southeast, southwest)

Charges – Actual medical insurance cost (target variable)

To build a regression model that accurately predicts medical insurance costs using various predictive features.

Techniques Used

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical data)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn

Feature Engineering and correlation analysis

Model Building using algorithms such as:

Linear Regression

Decision Tree Regressor

Random Forest Regressor

Model Evaluation using metrics like R² Score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Squared Error (MSE)
